## Database Utilities 

### dbpop.py

This script will populate the database used in other projects sought by TC. 

Using this script depends on different file paths, such as the sqlite3 database file in question and the csv files used to populate the database. 

After confirming the location of these and putting their file paths into the code, run the following python script from within the scripts directory:  
```
python dbpop.py 
```
